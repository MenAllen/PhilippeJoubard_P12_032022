# Getting Started with SportSee App

This project needs backend and frontend apps.

## Backend

clone this repo https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard

### `npm install` to install the backend

### `npm start` to run the backend
Message 'magic happens on port 3000' indicates the backend has successfully started on port 3000

## Frontend

clone this repo https://github.com/MenAllen/PhilippeJoubard_P12_032022.git
### `npm install` to install the frontend

### `npm start` to run the frontend
A message will warn you that port 3000 is already in use and asks if you want to use another one. Then type the key 'y' to accept. A browser window then opens so that you can access the app
